  <h2>Medicine Notes</h2>
  <p>The key concept for studying is constructive alignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructive alignment as the coiner of the tern John Biggs explains "we start with the outcomes we intend students to learn, and align teaching and assessment to those outcomes"</li>
<li>For example if you want to teach someone to play the piano, let your student start tinkering on it, and give hints along the way. Don't give them hundreds of Power Point slides on finger movement, chords, history of Mozart, and the etymology of the word 'piano.'</li>
<li>Real example applied to medicine
<ul>
<li>Short answer exams; make your own short answer questions or use past papers (if your school provides them) and try to answer them!</li>
<li>Multichoice exams; get access to a question bank (e.g. Passmedicine, BMJ onExaminations, and etc)</li>
<li>OSCE; if it is simulated (like you are examining an actor), practice on your friends. If it is real life patients, practice on patients in hospital (obviously after getting informed consent)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Active learning</p>
<ul>
<li>For active learning you have to 'engage' with your material. This can be done in many ways
<ul>
<li>Summarise your notes</li>
<li>Write the notes in your own words</li>
<li>Compare and contrast idea</li>
<li>Write your own exam questions</li>
<li>Do past exams</li>
<li>Teach it to others</li>
<li>And many more! Go out and find your own, that is because everyone is a unique snowflake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Out of these teaching the material to others is arguable the most effective (apparently 90% recall compared to reading which is like 20% (unless you have photographic memory), and it has it own name; "Protege effect")
<ul>
<li>Teach your family or relatives</li>
<li>Teach your reflection on the mirror</li>
<li>Teach your Rubik's cube</li>
<li>I dare you to teach your lecturer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
