  <h2>Thinking</h2>
  <ul>
<li>
<p>Good quotes (in no particular order)&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Me; my today won't exist without yesterday. Change today not yesterday</li>
<li>Me; my past may be unfortunate, but I can make others fortunate</li>
<li>Elon Musk "Tesla, SpaceX, and the quest for a fantastic future"; I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask."</li>
<li>Sun Tzu; "it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperilled in a hundred battles.</li>
<li>Yu Gwansun; [my translation from Korean] "Freedom is from the heavens, no one has the right to take it"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matthew 16:24; whoever wants to be my [Jesus] disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark 10:27; with man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul Kalanithi "When breath becomes air"; ...yet the paradox is that scientific methodology is the product of human hands and thus cannot reach some permanent truth. We build scientific theories to organise and manipulate the world, to reduce phenomena into manageable units...Science may provide the most useful way to organise empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicted on its inability to grasp the most central aspect of human life; hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honour, weakness, striving, suffering and virtue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John 13:34; A new commandment I give you: love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciple, if you love one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luke 6:37; do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mahatma Karamchand&nbsp;Gandhi; the weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Galatians 5:14; the entire law is summed up in a single command: "love your neighbour as yourself."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Albert Einstein; everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahn Changho; [my translation from Korean] "Only who can truly love themselves can love and help others"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Albert Schweitzer; For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus' name, someone must step in to help in Jesus' name; for every person who robbed, someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed, someone must bless.The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others.Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier.</p>
