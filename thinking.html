  <h2>Thinking</h2>
  <ul>
<li>
<p>Good quotes (in no particular order)&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Me; my today won't exist without yesterday. Change today not yesterday</li>
<li>Me; my past may be unfortunate, but I can make others fortunate</li>
<li>Elon Musk "Tesla, SpaceX, and the quest for a fantastic future"; I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask."</li>
<li>Sun Tzu; "it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperilled in a hundred battles.</li>
<li>Yu Gwansun; [my translation from Korean] "Freedom is from the heavens, no one has the right to take it"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matthew 16:24; whoever wants to be my [Jesus] disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark 10:27; with man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul Kalanithi "When breath becomes air"; ...yet the paradox is that scientific methodology is the product of human hands and thus cannot reach some permanent truth. We build scientific theories to organise and manipulate the world, to reduce phenomena into manageable units...Science may provide the most useful way to organise empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicted on its inability to grasp the most central aspect of human life; hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honour, weakness, striving, suffering and virtue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John 13:34; A new commandment I give you: love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciple, if you love one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luke 6:37; do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mahatma Karamchand&nbsp;Gandhi; the weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Galatians 5:14; the entire law is summed up in a single command: "love your neighbour as yourself."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Albert Einstein; everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahn Changho; [my translation from Korean] "Only who can truly love themselves can love and help others"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Albert Schweitzer; For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus' name, someone must step in to help in Jesus' name; for every person who robbed, someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed, someone must bless.The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others.Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering (idea under construction)</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it always bad? For example, some people are born without pain receptors (congenital insensitivity to pain), and are continuously hurting and burning themselves, but they never notice. Maybe pain and suffering is the mechanism through which we learn.</li>
<li>For example, lets say you sit exams and always get 100 percent. Obviously you will never change your study technique or habit, when it goes well. But, when you don't do well, it encourages you to find new study techniques.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preaching (idea under construction)</p>
<ul>
<li>Many evangelical Christians or apologists, describe that freedom is the biggest gift from God. For example, in the Book of Genesis (Bible), God allows Adam to name the animals. This is the first example of God giving freedom to humans. Then tells him that he should not eat the fruit in the 'middle of the garden [of Eden].' This is another indication that God gave humans to choose what they want to do.&nbsp;</li>
<li>So obviously, people have the right to believe whatever they want. Therefore, I think it is wasteful to preach unless someone is genuinely interested in learning more about Christianity and other religions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts? (idea under construction)
<ul>
<li>I have 5 fingers on my hand (as of 2017). This is definitely a fact because I can see 5 fingers.
<ul>
<li>But have we know the human eye is great but also full of mistakes (e.g. optical illusions and mirages)</li>
<li>So do I actually have 5 fingers?</li>
<li>Rene Descartes said "cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am)," since I think I have 5 fingers, it doesn't matter if I see 7 or 5 fingers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let's not go there...anyway there are lots of facts with very conclusive evidences (e.g. Earth is round)</li>
<li>But some are not as perfect, for instance evolution. I reading some of the counter arguments for it (readily available in the internet)
<ul>
<li>Have you seen evolution happening? Darwin's finches and dog breeding are examples of natural selection not evolution.</li>
<li>No one has even managed to make a single celled organism</li>
<li>Some argue that under certain circumstances molecules of phospholipids can be formed and they eventually clump up into round spheres (micelles), which provide an environment different from the outside. Interesting...</li>
<li>Why do some geneticists say mutations are harmful?</li>
<li>You decide if you want to believe in evolution!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let's say you learnt that New Zealand's population is 4,756,172 as at Monday, 06 Feb 2017 at 02:05:17 p.m (Statistics New Zealand).
<ul>
<li>How do I know it is true? What if Statistics New Zealand is making up numbers?</li>
<li>You may argue that Statistics New Zealand is a reputable organisation?</li>
<li>Overall you need to have faith in evidence.</li>
<li>Think about the people who say that the photo of planet Earth from space is photoshopped...How do we convince them?</li>
<li>Anyway knowledge is difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
